<!-- After Login/Register with Firebase, save that user in the database
    For that we will be sending current user's access token to our backend using Firebase Admin tool, we will make sure that the token is generated... from our firebase app
    This  is kind of like a server side validation of the token
    If it is valid then => we can be sure that we have a genuenine user
    So we will save that user to database

    At that point we will start with Graphql schema > resolvers
    Before implementing firebase admin to our server
